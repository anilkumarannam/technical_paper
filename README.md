# EFFECTIVE CODE BASE MANAGEMENT WITH SOLID
## Abstract
It's quite natural to see that the environment of the code gets updated frequently, in terms of the versions of the Operating System where the code gets deployed, in some cases database needs to be migrated from one to another. To make sure that the software is more secure and perfomant in terms of space and time. For all the above cases atleast some minor changes needs to be made in base case, and the entire code needs to be refactored in worst case. However any chage that made to the code inevitably affecting the rest of the code in one way or the other. And it become very complex to deal with code in worst case conditions. Here comes the concept of SOLID which reduces the complexity of the changes and refactoring.
